				Brief Instructions on How To Provide Input Into the Program:
--CHOOSING MENU OPTIONS--
	The program itself prompts the user with very detailed specifics as to what kind of input to put in.
	The code is not case sensitive, but it is sensitive to spaces. For example, if A: Add Calendar is an option
	for the user, the input can be "a" or "A" with no errors.
	
--INPUT FOR E: ADD EVENT--
	The input for anything event related is very sensitive to the amount of spaces as well as the formatting
	for the space and for the date.
	For example, if an event is set to start at 11am, the input must be "11:00:00 am" with that exact amount
	of spacing and information.
	For example, if the event is set to start on March 3, the input must be "March 3" with no extra whitespace. 
--OVERALL INPUT--
	The instructions I typed out were trying to be as descriptive as possible, so for all other scenarios, 
	the input should be easy to follow, considering I provided examples as I did above.
